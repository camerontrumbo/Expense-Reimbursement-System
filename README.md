# Expense-Reimbursement-System

## Project Description

In this project, there are two different kinds of accounts, a manager account and an employee account. The employees can create a reimbursement request with which they can choose amount, write a description, and select the type of reimbursement. Managers can choose to deny or approve these requests and can also create new accounts for employees or managers. When a manager creates an account, an email is sent to the recipient with the username and password for the account.
